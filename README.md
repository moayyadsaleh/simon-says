This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the classic game Simon Says. The game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of button presses, testing their memory and pattern recognition skills.

Technical Highlights:
Interactive Gameplay: Engaging and interactive gaming experience right in the browser. Click the colored buttons or use keyboard inputs to play the game and progress through levels.

DOM Manipulation: The game utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the game interface, display levels, and provide visual feedback to the player's actions.

Event Handling: Event listeners are implemented to detect button clicks and key presses, allowing for responsive gameplay and user interaction.
Audio Feedback: Audio feedback for button presses and game events. Different sound effects are played based on the player's actions and game outcomes.
CSS Styling: The game interface is styled using CSS, providing an appealing visual design and enhancing the overall gaming experience.


Practical Uses:
Skill Building: Sharpen your memory and pattern recognition skills by challenging yourself with increasingly complex sequences of button presses.

How to Play:
Start the Game: Press any key to start the game. The level title will indicate the current level.

Follow the Pattern: Watch and listen carefully as the game highlights buttons in a specific sequence. Your task is to repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

Repeat the Sequence: After the game shows the pattern, it's your turn to reproduce it. Click the buttons in the same order as shown.
Level Up: If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will advance to the next level, adding one more step to the pattern.

Keep Going: As you progress, the patterns become longer and more challenging. Pay close attention to the increasing complexity and try to remember the sequence accurately.

Game Over: If you make a mistake and click the wrong button or fail to repeat the sequence correctly, the game is over. You can restart by pressing any key.
